This paper presents an approach for real-time
training and testing for document image classification. In pro-
duction environments, it is crucial to perform accurate and
(time-)efficient training. Existing deep learning approaches for
classifying documents do not meet these requirements, as they
require much time for training and fine-tuning the deep architec-
tures. Motivated from Computer Vision, we propose a two-stage
approach. The first stage trains a deep network that works as
feature extractor and in the second stage, Extreme Learning Ma-
chines (ELMs) are used for classification. The proposed approach
outperforms all previously reported structural and deep learning
based methods with a final accuracy of 83.24 % on Tobacco-
3482 dataset, leading to a relative error reduction of 25 %
when compared to a previous Convolutional Neural Network
(CNN) based approach (DeepDocClassifier). More importantly,
the training time of the ELM is only 1.176 seconds and the
overall prediction time for 2, 482 images is 3.066 seconds. As
such, this novel approach makes deep learning-based document
classification suitable for large-scale real-time applications.
