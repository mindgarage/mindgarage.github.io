In contemporary history, the digitization of human societies and media convergence
are inextricably linked. Framework conditions for media representatives, recipients,
interest groups and regulatory bodies are changing accordingly. Due to digitization
in all media sectors, it is much necessary to analyse the media market conditions
and their operations. The objective of this study is to develop and evaluate methods
to systematically classify public radio stations in Germany to discover and interpret
their broadcasts on a set of empirical research questions. This study helps in assigning
a DNA like identification to each of the radio stations based on the broadcast
music and music-related editorial contents. The study is divided into three tasks:
One, data collection and identification; two, data validation; and three, data mining
to find answers for a list of given empirical factors which are understood as the DNA
structure of corresponding broadcast station.
