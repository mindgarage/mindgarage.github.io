During the last week two new publications have been uploaded on arxiv. I am happy and a bit proud that the Vision of the MindGarage leads to such nice research contributions. I use this chance to thank the members and supporters of the MindGarage for their active participation!
Especially, Andreas, Ayushman, John, and Shan have done a great job!
See the project desciptions in <a href="http://blog.mindgarage.de/project/object%20recognition/context%20representation/2017-03-multilevel-context-representaion"> Multilevel context representation </a> and <a href="http://blog.mindgarage.de/project/image%20understanding/image%20generation/generative%20adversarial%20neural%20networks/2017-03-tac-gan">Text Conditioned Auxiliary Classifier Generative Adversarial Network</a>
in the <a href="http://blog.mindgarage.de/projects/">projects section</a>.
