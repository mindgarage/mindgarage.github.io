During the last week two new publications have been uploaded on arxiv. I am happy and a bit proud that the Vision of the MindGarage leads to such nice research contributions. I use this chance to thank the members and supporters of the MindGarage for their active participation!
Especially, Andreas, Ayushman, John, and Shan have done a great job! See the project desciptions in <a href="#"> Multilevel context representation </a> and <a href="#">Text Conditioned Auxiliary Classifier Generative Adversarial Network</a> in the <a href="{{'/teaching/seminar-and-projects/' | prepend: site.baseurl}}">projects section</a>.
