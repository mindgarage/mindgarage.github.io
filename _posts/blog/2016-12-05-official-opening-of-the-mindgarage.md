Today it was the time of celebration. We officially opened the MindGarage.
We are very happy that the Vice-President of the University, Prof. Norbert Wehn gave a very nice welcome address where he sketched the [history](/#history) of the Mindgarage and AI in Kaiserslautern. Also, he underlined that the leadership team of the University of Kaiserslautern supports the MindGarage and they will find a location where we can stay on the long-term. Thank you!

After visionary talks of [Marcus Liwicki]({{ '/team/liwicki' | prepend: site.baseurl }}) and Werner Weiss (CEO of [Insiders Technologies](http://insiders-technologies.de/)), two student members of the Mindgarage, John and Ayushman, presented their view of the MindGarage. They are happy that the MindGarge is a place to meet and interact, they are happy to have direct discussions with the experienced researchers Marcus and Shan, and that - last but not least - the MindGarage feels like a family. This has been said so nicely that I almost began to cry (see pictures below :) )

After the short opening speeches, there was a chance for networking and exchanging research ideas (subject of the [next post]({{'/blog/celebration-after-the-mindgarage-opening/' | prepend : site.baseurl}})). All in all it was a very successful evening and I am very thankful to everyone who came and especially who helped making this evening and the MindGarage such a success (see last slide as picture below).
