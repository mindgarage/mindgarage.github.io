With the MindStorm Open Research Forum, the MindGarage wants to offer a platform for OpenMinded researchers and practicioners from University & industry to present, discuss, and exchange their ideas.

Anyone who likes can present and share their ideas and post open problems & issues. Small food and beverages will be provided with the support of Insiders Technologies.

The MindStorm open discussion is held every two weeks on Monday evening at 18:00 EST at MindGarage. The Ovation MindGarage is a place for students and researchers who really want to experience Very Deep Learning.
