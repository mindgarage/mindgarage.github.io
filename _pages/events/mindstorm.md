### Session Highlights

1.  At the Mindstorm session, we started with a discussion about the upcoming hackathon. The hackathon will start on Friday, 27th April 2018 at Mindgarage and the results will be announced on Sunday, 29th April 2018 at 12:00 pm EST.

2.  Marcus Liwicki shared some insights about the data and how and when the Hackathon will be organized.

3.  Some papers were discussed by [Kumar Shridhar](https://kumar-shridhar.github.io/){:target="_blank"}:

    - <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.03308" target="_blank">Predictive Neural Networks </a> : where the authors showed that linearly activated recurrent neural networks can approximate any time-dependent function f(t) given by a number of function values. The approximation can effectively be learned by simply solving a linear equation system; no backpropagation or similar methods are needed.

    - <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1605.07969.pdf" target="_blank">Adaptive Neural Compilation </a> : where the authors showed that it is possible to compile programs written in a low-level language to a differentiable representation.

4.  <a href="https://www.mendeley.com/guides/desktop" target="_blank"> Mendeley Desktop </a>: A very useful application to keep and store all the research papers was discussed by <a href="https://kumar-shridhar.github.io/" target="_blank">Kumar Shridhar</a>.

5.  Finally, the session ended with a topic presentation on 'Multi Modal learning' by Saurabh Varshneya.
