### Course Description

This course is an introduction to deep learning. It covers the basic concepts of deep learning, including the mathematical foundations of neural networks, the backpropagation algorithm, and the stochastic gradient descent method. It also covers the most important deep learning architectures, including convolutional neural networks, recurrent neural networks, and generative adversarial networks. The course will also cover the most important applications of deep learning, including image classification, image generation, image segmentation, object detection, and natural language processing. The course will also cover the some important tools for deep learning, such as PyTorch.

__Credits__: 4 CP <br>
