### What is CVAT?

CVAT is an open-source web-based tool for computer vision annotation developed by [Intel](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/homepage.html). It is designed to help computer vision engineers to annotate images and videos for object detection, semantic segmentation, and person-attributes recognition.

#### Project Goals
